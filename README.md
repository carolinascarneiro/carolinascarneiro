I'm a since 2018 Berlin-based ex-German teacher who got to participate on a Hackathon to develop an app to teach German and
ended up finding more interesting the programming part than the German language one. Since then, my tech journey started and
now I've been on it for more than 3 years.

I love to develop interesting applications, to show my creativity through coding and to see the very nice results development
technologies allow us to have.

In my Software Engineering path, I made experiences with:
🤖 Data Science and Machine Learning
🐍 Python
☕ Java
💻 HTML, CSS, Javascript (WebDev core combo)
©️#
🏃🏻‍♀️ Agile methods and SCRUM frameworks

Personally, I'm also:
🏳️‍🌈 Part of the LGBTQIA+ community
👾 Into MMROPG
🎸🪘🎤 Very much into music making and producing
🚲 Amateur bike lover
👯‍♀️ Feminist (intersectional)
